While the border wall construction has been controversial every step of the way, the construction in Organ Pipe Cactus is happening at Monument Hill, which contains burial grounds with cultural significance for the O’odham people, who have lived in the borderlands before it was divided between the United States and Mexico. </p><p> Ted Norris Jr., chairman of the Tohono O’odham Nation, just east of Organ Pipe Cactus, decried the entire project as senseless destruction of ancestral land. “The Tohono O’odham Nation is adamantly opposed to the construction of the 30-foot, fortified border wall, which would irrevocably harm cultural sites, sacred sites and the environment,” Norris said in a statement. “It is all the more tragic that billions of taxpayer dollars are being wasted on an empty campaign slogan that will do little to address border security challenges.” </p><p> US Customs and Border Protection confirmed the activity. “The controlled blasting is targeted and will continue intermittently for the rest of the month,” a spokesperson said in a statement. CBP says that they will have an “environmental monitor” present during construction, but Norris said that federal agencies have not consulted with the Tohono O’odham Nation before beginning construction, as federal policy requires. </p><p> As The Intercept’s Ryan Devereaux explained in his November 2019 coverage of border wall protests, life changed for the O’odham people with the arrival of a new border enforcement policy called Prevention Through Deterrence. The strategy redirected migrants away from larger cities like El Paso and San Diego, and into remote desert areas like the Tohono O’odham Nation. The people living there did what they could to assist the influx of migrants showing up on their doorstep, but then Border Patrol arrived: </p><em> <p>In relatively short order, O’odham lands became occupied territory, crawling with Border Patrol agents, penned in with vehicle checkpoints and monitored 24/7 with the latest in surveillance technology. As the interdiction industry put down roots, an economy for getting past the border guards ballooned. On the economically struggling Tohono O’odham Nation, the allure of potentially easy money trapped more than a few people in the cycle of arrest, felony conviction, and incarceration that plays out in communities across the country, including those far from the border. In 2009, the Associated Press reported a sixtyfold increase in the “percentage of suspected drug smugglers arrested by Tohono O’odham police who are tribal members” over the preceding two decades. “The jump is due to a surge in recruiting that stems from the growing number of Border Patrol agents on the Tohono O’Odham Nation and the recent construction of steel vehicle barriers that line most of the 75 miles of international border,” the AP noted.</p>

<p>More enforcement meant more illicit activity, which required more enforcement — it was self-sustaining cycle with real-life consequences for the O’odham people. “Growing up, we reached a point where we didn’t know we had rights,” Ortega explained. </p></em><p> O’odham people have been joined by environmental activists in opposing the construction at Organ Pipe for the threat it poses to cultural sites as well as natural resources. The national monument also includes Quitobaquito Springs, one of the only water sources in the desert area, which has been made vulnerable by the pumping of groundwater to mix concrete for the border wall. The nation has asked CBP to create a two-mile buffer zone around Quitobaquito, according to reporting from the Arizona Republic. </p>`, image: 'https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Border-Wall-Organ-Pipe-CROPPED.jpg?resize=1536,863', showRating: 0 }, { author: 'Tyler Olson', url: 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-waives-contracting-laws-border-wall', title: 'DHS waives contracting laws in bid to speed up border wall construction', body: `<p> In a move to speed up the construction of 177 miles of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, the Trump administration is waiving a set of laws that applies to how the Department of Homeland Security can work with federal contractors. </p> <p> The 10 laws the waiver applies to stipulate that the department allow open competition for contracts, justify its contractor selections and secure bonds that protect the government from financial loss should the project not be completed correctly, among other things. </p> <p> "Under the president's leadership, we are building more wall, faster than ever before," the department said in a statement, according to the Associated Press. </p><p> Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has the authority to waive these contracting laws under a 2005 provision that gives him sweeping authority to do so when building border barriers. The option has previously been used to waive environmental impact reviews for sections of the border wall. </p><p> Trump's administration has invoked the waiver law 16 times, compared with five times under former President George W. Bush. </p><p> The wall sections to which Wolf's waiver applies will be built in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. </p><p> This is just the latest step the Trump administration has taken to advance its immigration agenda. Last week, DHS deployed 100 Customs and Border Protection agents to work with Immigrations Customs and Enforcement in a handful of U.S. cities that have not cooperated with the federal government in enforcing immigration laws. </p> <p> That move drew criticism from Democrats, including Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, who sent the department a letter over the weekend demanding that it "reverse course" on the decision. Among the 100 agents deployed were members of an elite unit known as BORTAC, essentially the SWAT team of CBP. </p><p> "Because this initiative is unnecessary, unwelcome, dangerous, menacing, retaliatory and unlikely to achieve its stated goal," Warren and Markey said, "we write to demand that you reverse course and to pose questions to better understand your rationale for employing paramilitary-style immigration personnel equipped with 'stun grenades and enhanced Special Forces-type training, including sniper certification' in Boston and elsewhere in the United States." </p><p> Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced its intent to redirect $7.2 billion in funds appropriated for the Pentagon to build the border wall, an action Democrats called a "slap in the face to the members of the Armed Fores and their families." </p><p> The Trump administration announced where the funding for $3.8 billion of that $7.2 billion would come from last week. In details first reported by the Washington Post, the Department of Defense plans to divert funding from the construction of 17 aircraft, among other previously planned expenditures. </p>`, image: 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/1862/1048/AP19357256655791.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', showRating: 0 }, {author: 'John Binder', url: 'https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/13/trumps-pentagon-secures-3-8b-to-build-177-miles-of-border-wall/', title: 'Trump’s Pentagon Secures $3.8B to Build 177 Miles of Border Wall', body: '<p> On Thursday, Pentagon officials announced about $2.2 billion in Defense Department funding would be redirected from counter-narcotics efforts to the construction of border wall. Another $1.6 billion originally allocated for National Guard equipment will be used to build the wall. </p><p> “Last month we received a new request from the Department of Homeland Security asking for assistance in blocking drug-smuggling corridors on Federal land along the southern border of the United States,” a Defense Department official said in a statement. He added: </p><p> In response, the Secretary of Defense authorized support of $3.8 billion to build approximately 177 miles of fencing that will help to protect our borders. We will continue to support DHS and other agencies as needed to keep our homeland is secure. </p><p> The additional funding is on top of the more than $11 billion that has already been allocated to build about 500 miles of border wall, bringing the total level of border wall funding to about $14.8 billion. </p><p> This month, Trump administration officials said they now have secured enough funding to build 1,000 miles of border wall with about 500 of those miles being completed by 2021. </p> <p> Illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border has been on the decline for eight consecutive months after reaching historic levels last year. In January, Border Patrol agents caught less than 30,000 border crossers and illegal aliens attempting to make their way into the U.S. Federal immigration officials have said they only apprehend about half of all illegal aliens, indicating that another 29,000 illegal aliens may have crossed illegally last month, undetected by Border Patrol. </p> <p> The decline in illegal immigration can be directly credited to Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy and his agreements with Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador where border crossers seeking asylum from those countries are returned immediately to await their asylum cases rather than being freed into the U.S. interior as has been done for decades. </p>', image: 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/03/Border-Wall-Building-640x480.jpg', showRating: 0}, {author: 'Christine Hauser', url: 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/trump-border-wall-arizona-native-americans.html?searchResultPosition=1', title: 'Blasting in Construction of Border Wall Is Affecting Tribal Areas', body: `<p><em> One site disturbed by the construction, which is taking place in a UNESCO ecological preserve, is a resting place for Apache warriors. </em></p><p> Blasting operations for construction of President Trump’s border wall in Arizona have begun to disrupt a UNESCO ecological preserve that encompasses Native American ancestral lands and burial grounds. </p><p> Construction crews have been blasting at Monument Hill, a resting place for primarily Apache warriors, and bulldozing at Quitobaquito Springs, a pilgrimage site, according to the office of Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, who recently toured the area in his southern Arizona district. </p><p> In 1976, UNESCO made Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument an international biosphere reserve, the agency’s designation for areas protected to conserve biological and cultural diversity while allowing scientists to study the impact of development. </p><p> After visiting several sites on Jan. 20 with members of the Tohono O’odham Nation, Mr. Grijalva, the Democratic chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said that more were at risk. He plans to hold a committee hearing about the damage. </p><p> In remarks made in a video posted to Twitter on Sunday, Mr. Grijalva echoed warnings from the National Park Service, which said in a study last year that the construction of Mr. Trump’s wall along the southwestern border would significantly damage or completely destroy more than 20 archaeological sites in Organ Pipe Cactus, a national monument comprising 517 square miles of mountain ranges and desert land. </p><p> The park is sandwiched between Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and the Tohono O’odham Reservation, whose leaders have said the border wall would virtually split the indigenous community in half. </p><p> In his statement, Mr. Grijalva referred to destruction that had taken place after his visit. Information about it had been conveyed to his office in the past two weeks, according to Geoffrey Nolan, a spokesman for the congressman. </p><p> A Customs and Border Protection spokesman said on Wednesday that “the construction contractor has begun controlled blasting, in preparation for new border wall system construction within the Roosevelt Reservation at Monument Mountain.” </p><p> “The controlled blasting is targeted and will continue intermittently for the rest of the month,” he said in the statement, which was reported last week by The Intercept. The spokesman added that an “environmental monitor” would be at the site. </p><p> Ned Norris Jr., chairman of the Tohono O’odham Nation, said in a statement provided on Tuesday that the use of explosives on the border wall would “irrevocably harm cultural sites, sacred sites and the environment.” </p><p> While the two sites are not on the reservation, he said, federal agencies are required to consult with the tribe before any action that “significantly affects Indian lands, tribal rights or protected tribal resources.” </p><p> Laiken Jordahl, a campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in an interview on Tuesday that he had recently learned that explosives had been used to create a 60-foot-wide patrol road on Monument Hill for the future border wall. At least one sign near the construction zone designated a blast area. </p><p> “It cuts through the middle of the hill,” he said. “They are clearing out this huge swath of land.” </p><p> He said that a similar track had been bulldozed near the springs, and that the construction crews were digging wells to extract water to mix with concrete. </p><p> Mr. Grijalva, whose constituency includes four tribal nations, said the construction work was also affecting the ecology of the area by upending cactuses and encroaching on freshwater areas. He said the administration was using federal waivers to build the wall. </p><p> The congressman’s tour and the danger to the sites were reported last month by The Arizona Republic. In October, construction crews at Quitobaquito Springs discovered fragments of human remains believed to have belonged to O’odham ancestors from centuries ago, it said. </p><p> Mr. Trump has pressured Department of Homeland Security officials to speed the construction of his border wall, a highlight of his policy initiatives. </p>`, image: 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/11/multimedia/11xp-wallSUB/11xp-wallSUB-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp', showRating: 0}, {author: 'Timothy Puko', url: 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-environmental-battle-over-the-mexican-border-wall-11581625154', title: 'The Environmental Battle Over the Mexican Border Wall', body: `<p> SONORAN DESERT, Ariz.—As President Trump pushes to speed construction of the Mexican border wall, both opponents of the wall and his administration are invoking the environment—one side to stop the barrier, and the other to build it. </p><p> Environmental groups say an impassable 30-foot-high wall would prevent endangered pronghorn, wolves, wildcats and other animals from roaming the borderlands for food, water and mates, while also destroying native plants and other threatened species in parks and wildlife preserves that line the... </p>

The clubhouse is shuttered, par signs are fading and the once-manicured greens are fields of weeds. </p> <p> In 2008, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, working with the University of Texas at Brownsville, built a security fence on the southern edge of the campus that effectively walled off the popular golf course from the rest of the city. </p><p> Golfers stopped coming, and the course, which was operated by the university, eventually went bankrupt. </p><p> "What used to be a very active place, very friendly place, for students and for our golf team and for winter Texans has become a deserted, sad, desolate no man's land," says Juliet García, the former university president, who fiercely fought the border wall. She stands in the empty parking lot, littered with trash and palm fronds. </p><p> "None of us come over here," Garcia says, looking around sadly. "You don't feel protected in any part of the land that is south of the wall." </p><p> When the government constructs its border barrier in California, Arizona and New Mexico, it runs along the arrow-straight land boundary with Mexico. But in Texas, that boundary is the meandering Rio Grande. And because of flooding concerns about flooding, the border wall is often built some distance away — as much as a mile north of the river. That leaves thousands of acres between the water and the wall — all of it American soil — as no man's land. </p><p> Landowners fear the wall will effectively sever their acreage from the United States, leaving it abandoned, lawless and unprofitable. </p><p> Trump has pledged to build more than 500 miles of new border wall by 2021, if he wins a second term. On Thursday, the Pentagon informed Congress it would reprogram $3.8 billion — that was earmarked for aircraft, vehicles and ships — to pay for 177 additional miles of barrier to be built along the western desert border. </p><p> While some applaud a 30-foot-tall structure to keep out immigrants and drug runners, down in the Rio Grande Valley it has run into opposition. So far, 55 property owners have gone to court to try to block the survey and construction crews. </p><p>  The owners of River Bend Resort & Golf Club, located just west of Brownsville, were planning a major expansion worth millions of dollars when they heard the border wall would slice through their development. </p><p> "A 30-foot wall through the middle of the property completely kills our project," says Jeremy Barnard, part of the family that owns River Bend. Nearly 700 Americans and Canadians from the frigid north relocate there during the winter to enjoy short sleeves and margaritas, and live in upscale mobile homes amid palm trees on a sharp bend in the river. Trump's wall would go up beside an existing levee that bisects the property. </p><p> "The problem with that is 70% of our property is south of the levee," says Barnard. That includes the rec center, the pool, tennis courts, and 15 of 18 holes. All of it would be cut off by the wall. The frustrating thing, he says, is they rarely see unauthorized immigrants and drug smugglers passing through the development. Nonetheless, CBP reports that the Rio Grande Valley is the nation's hot spot for narcotics and human smuggling. </p><p> His family is negotiating urgently with CBP to move the wall slightly north so it won't cut their property in half. And yet Jeremy Barnard's politics haven't changed. He remains loyal to President Trump. </p><p> "I've got friends that disagree with me and they say, 'How could you vote for this man? His wall wants to tear apart your community,' " he says, "The main thing I tell them is, 'Look, the thought that I'm gonna agree with somebody a hundred percent of the time, especially a politician, is just outrageous.' But I do agree with what he's trying to do as far as securing the border. I just have an issue with the blanket — let's build a wall everywhere." </p><p> West of the River Bend Resort, the landscape reverts to fields of onions, cotton and corn. Richard Drawe leans against his pickup truck at his farm headquarters south of the town of Weslaco. He has worked this rich delta soil all his life, like his father and grandfather before him. </p><p> "I'm 70 years old and it's gonna ruin my lifestyle here of living in the country," he says. "To have that wall there is just gonna really disturb me." </p> <p> Drawe knows he can't beat Washington, D.C., so last fall, he reluctantly sold the government a ribbon of land so they could erect the fence across his property. Like Jeremy Barnard, Richard Drawe supports Trump and is all for increasing border security — he just doesn't want the wall on his property. </p><p> "I told them that this stupid wall is gonna have lights on it. It's gonna be like being behind a prison wall, lights and everything," Drawe says. "And I said, 'You put them lights up on me and my house, I'm gonna shoot em out.' Of course, I had time to calm down." </p><p> He has seen what's happened over the past decade to riverside land isolated by the border wall that was erected by President George W. Bush. He says the acreage is effectively ceded to Mexico. He's worried that bad hombres will cross the river from Mexico and threaten his farmhands. </p><p> "Like I told the Border Patrol, I said, 'Look, you know good and well that once you build this wall all the agents will be doing is patrolling up and down the wall. They're never gonna go on down to the river anymore.' And he yelled back at me, 'Oh, the Rio Grande is the first line of defense.' Baloney," Drawe says. "You just wait a few years." </p><p> CBP is aware of landowners' misgivings. A spokesman said, "The Border Patrol will continue to operate on both sides of the barrier, to include the riverine environment." Further, the agency will install electric gates with security codes to give landowners access to the south side of the wall. </p><p> This is cold comfort to Fred Cavazos, whose extended family owns a rustic campground on the river south of the city of Mission. "We were raised here," says Cavazos, 70 years old and in a wheelchair. "My dad taught me how to fish here, how to get a shovel and dig for worms." </p><p> His main income is from tenants who have built weekend shanties along the water's edge. "A lot of them own boats. A lot of them own jet skis," he says. "So they come down with fajitas and sausages Saturdays and Sundays and barbecue." </p><p> The government wants to put the wall, a gate and a 150-foot-wide patrol zone along the north end of the property. The family worries that the tenants may not want to be walled off from the rest of Texas. Acreage south of the wall is "very lightly patrolled" by the Border Patrol, says Rey Anzaldua, a 75-year-old cousin and co-owner. </p><p> "If people come across the river and steal from our tenants who are here on the river, then probably we are going to lose a lot of the tenants," Anzaldua says. </p><p> Like many large families in the Rio Grande Valley, the Cavazos clan is split. Some want to accept what they think is a generous offer from the government — nearly $400,000 for six acres. But Anzaldua wonders what happens if one day they decide to put the land up for sale. </p><p> "The problem is the devaluation of the property," he says. "Nobody wants to buy property that's on the river side of the wall. So this is what the fight's going to be about." </p><p> Anzaldua and Cavazos are fighting CBP in federal court. Maybe if they drag it out until Election Day, they say, a Democrat will win the White House and halt the border wall. </p>`, image: 'https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/02/12/dsc08144-edit1_custom-3f04b09eaf2f8a253032652ac934b6a3beb327d7-s2500-c85.jpg', showRating: 0}, {author: 'Andrew Taylor', url: 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-to-transfer-3-8-billion-from-military-to-fund-border-wall', title: `Trump to transfer $3.8 billion from military to fund border wall`, body: `<p> WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is transferring $3.8 billion in recently passed military funding to finance construction of the president’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall, angering not just Democrats but also GOP defense hawks. </p><p> Thursday’s move by the Pentagon would transfer money from National Guard units, aircraft procurement and shipbuilding to anti-drug accounts that can finance construction of new wall. </p><p> The maneuver, announced in “reprogramming” documents provided to lawmakers, came in for harsh criticism by Rep. Mack Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee. Democrats slammed the transfers as well, but Trump faced no consequences when making similar transfers last year. </p><p> “Congress has the constitutional authority to determine how defense dollars are spent,” Thornberry said in a statement. “The re-programming today is contrary to Congress’s constitutional authority.” </p><p> Trump’s action comes less than two months after he signed a huge appropriations package into law. He alienated lawmakers on both sides last year when diverting funding intended for popular projects on military bases. </p><p> This time, the Pentagon is targeting $1.3 billion for National Guard equipment and excess procurement of aircraft like the F-35 and V-22 Ospreys, favored by many lawmakers for the jobs they bring to their districts and states. He’s also eliminating funding for an amphibious assault ship built in Mississippi and an Expeditionary Fast Transport ship that’s built in Alabama, represented by Sen. Richard Shelby, the Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee. </p><p> Trump’s fiscal 2021 budget, released only Monday, contains a $2 billion request for the wall, less than Trump asked for last year, which reflected the fact that Trump has more money for the wall than can be spent immediately. </p><p> “Today (Trump) stole from our National Guard to pay for his wasteful wall,” said Sen.
